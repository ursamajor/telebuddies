  </h1>

  <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>
        <b>Input your major.</b>
        TeleBuddies connects your major requirements to your courses.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Input your previous courses.</b>
        What classes have you taken previously? TeleBuddies matches your major to classes that you've taken before to find the perfect match.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Input what you're looking for.</b> Whether you're looking for machine learning, economic development, or the history of English literature; we'll be sure to find something for you.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Find your courses!</b>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discover new classes.</h2>
    <p>
        We go through our database of courses and the past schedules of students using our application to recommend courses to you based on your own preferences!
    </p>

  <h2>Plan solid back-up courses.</h2>
    <p>
      TeleBears is never reliable. Use TeleBuddies to find back-up courses just in case if your number one schedule doesn't work out and you don't know what else to take.
    </p>
